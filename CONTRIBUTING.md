# How to contribute

We always welcome improvements, fixes, or documentation updates for our library!
To keep it simple for you, here are a few guidelines we'd like you to follow, so
that we can all have an easier time sorting out the improvements.

## Before making changes

  * Check if there exists an issue concerning your requests
  * Make an issue before you start coding, if one does not exist - maybe there's already a way to do what you want, or the issue is out of scopes

## Making changes

  * Implement your addition, bug-fix or documentation change
  * If there is new or changed functionality in the PR, add tests
  * Add documentation changes to `README.md` if needed

## Submitting changes

  * [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/DarkoKukovec/media-mixin/compare) with your changes
  * Write a short, but descriptive title (e.g. `Add support for webkit retina screens`)
  * Write a description containing at least the following:
    * A few sentences about what the pull request contains
    * (If code) usage example
    * Reference to an issue it solves, if any is present
